# Personal Project Files
This repository contains all my work and credits for my personal project. Here you will find the code for the website, .stl files for the robotic arm, the gerber files for the custom made PCB made using EasyEda, the code for the Arduino for Hardware controled pwm for the servo and the python code for the connection to the website using a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

# The Website
The website's back-end is writen in python. I am using the flask library. The backend is able to handle both "POST" and "GET" requests. 
The website's front-end is writen using the Angular Framerwork. It send the appropriate data to the back-end.

# The Robotic Arm
I first made a robotic arm but later decided to switch to another model made by eezyrobots.com. The model's name is EEzybotArm V2. (Files for arm 1 in the "CRANE V1" directory, Files for arm 2 in the "CRANE 2" directory)
For the connections to the servo, I made a custom PCB. (Files in the "PCB" directory). This makes my product more of a permanent solution. It is also a neater solution.
